                <p>
                YoloCon (Ypsilanti Online Learning Opportunity Conference) is an industry engagement conference organized by the <strong> <a href="https://emu-iasa.github.io/">Information Assurance Student Association (IASA)</a> </strong> at Eastern Michigan University.
                The conference provides a unique opportunity for cybersecurity professionals to speak and inspire the next generation. It is designed for companies to engage with students and professionals in the cybersecurity industry.
                </p>
                <p>
                YoloCon is the primary fundraiser for the IASA, and it supports all the events hosted by the association. 
                The conference enables students to grow their skills, learn about current technological advancements, compete in cybersecurity competitions, and expand their networks.
                Additionally, YoloCon grants students access to gamified learning resources that provide comprehensive training for competitions such as the National Cyber League and the National Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition. 
                By participating in YoloCon, companies can support and educate students in cybersecurity and strengthen the quality of applicants they can expect to see.
                </p>
